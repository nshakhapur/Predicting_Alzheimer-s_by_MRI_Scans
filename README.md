## Introduction
This project aims to predict whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease by analyzing brain MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for managing and potentially slowing the progression of the disease. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project seeks to provide a reliable tool for Alzheimer's detection with an accuracy of up to 98.16%.

## Project Overview
Early detection of Alzheimer's disease can significantly impact the quality of life for patients and their families. This project uses advanced CNN models to analyze brain MRI scans and predict the presence of Alzheimer's. The high accuracy achieved in this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics, offering a promising approach to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
